## ðŸ’» Getting started

### 1. Important point : closing

riot_api_manipulation uses parrallel threads to track left requests and the function API.close() terminates these threads.
Make sure to add it at the end of your script or at the closing of your application.
```python
api_league = API_LEAGUE("YOUR_API_KEY", "europe", "euw1")
# Exploiting api [...]
api_league.close()
```

### 2. Usage examples

###### Get summoner's last game infos
```python
# Opening the api manager with a key, a region and a server
api_league = API_LEAGUE("YOUR_API_KEY", Region.EUROPE, Server.EU_WEST)

# Getting summoner's informations
summoner = api_league.get_summoner("SUMMONER_NAME")

# Recovering his last game and searching his infos in it
last_match_infos = summoner.get_last_game()
                           .get_infos_of_summoner()

# Closing the api manager (for threads, as said earlier !)
api_league.close()

# Enjoy results
print(summoner)
print(last_match_infos)
```

###### Get summoner's last ranked games with infos and timeline
```python
# Opening the api manager with a key, a region and a server
api_league = API_LEAGUE("YOUR_API_KEY", Region.EUROPE, Server.EU_NORTH)

# Getting summoner's informations
summoner = api_league.get_summoner("SUMMONER_NAME")

# Recovering his 10 last ranked games infos and timelines
last_games_full = summoner.get_match_history(nb_matches=10, queue=QueueType.RANKED, load_infos=True, load_timelines=True)

# Closing the api manager (for threads, as said earlier !)
api_league.close()

# Enjoy results
for game in last_games_full:
    print(game.json)
    print(game.json_timeline)
```
